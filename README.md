# KhmerCoders Bot

## Introduction

This is a bot designed for the Khmer Coders community, supporting both Telegram and Discord platforms. Its primary function is to track message counts for members within a group and generate leaderboards.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the bot, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KhmerCoders/khmercoders-bot.git
    cd khmercoders-bot
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

For local development, you need to create a `config.json` file in the root directory of the project. This file is crucial for storing sensitive information like your Telegram bot token.

**Create `config.json`**:
In the root directory, create a file named `config.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "ENVIRONMENT": "dev",
  "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_DEV": "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
}
```

**Important**: Replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with the actual token you receive from BotFather (see "Telegram Bot Setup" below). This file is ignored by Git, so your token will not be committed to the repository.

### Running the Service

To start the bot locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the Cloudflare worker on your local machine, accessible at `http://localhost:8787`.

### Database Management

This project utilizes Cloudflare D1 for database storage, with the schema defined within the `migrations` directory.

#### Development Migrations

To apply migrations to your local development database:

```bash
npm run migrate:dev
```

#### Production Migrations

To apply migrations to the production database:

```bash
npm run migrate:prod
```

### Telegram Bot Setup

To integrate with Telegram:

1.  **Create Your Bot**: Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.
2.  **Use `/newbot`**: Follow the prompts to create a new bot, choosing a name and username.
3.  **Save Bot Token**: BotFather will provide you with a unique bot token. **Save this token**, as it's required for the `config.json` file.

#### Configuring the Webhook

After deploying your Cloudflare Worker, you must inform Telegram where to send updates. Set the webhook URL using the following command:

```bash
https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/telegram/webhook
```

**Remember to replace**:

- `<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>` with your actual Telegram bot token.
- `https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/telegram/webhook` with the URL of your deployed Cloudflare Worker.

### Testing Webhook Locally

To test the webhook functionality with a sample Telegram message against your local development server:

```bash
npm run test:webhook
```

This will send a test message to your local webhook endpoint.
